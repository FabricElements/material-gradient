The `<material-gradient>` component provides simple ways to use Material Design Gradients CSS styles
in your application. The following imports are available:

1. [gradient-styles.html](https://github.com/ernysans/material-gradient/blob/master/styles.html):
Background gradients that match the Material Design [palette](https://www.google.com/design/spec/style/color.html).

2. [gradient-classes.html](https://github.com/ernysans/material-gradient/blob/master/classes.html):
List of classes that uses the available gradients on `gradient-styles.html`.

We recommend importing each of these individual files, and using the style mixins
available in each ones, rather than the aggregated `material-gradient.html` as a whole.
